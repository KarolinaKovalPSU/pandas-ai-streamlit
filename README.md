# 🌟 Prompt-driven Analysis with PandasAI

This project leverages the OpenAI API to provide prompt-driven analysis on data uploaded via a CSV file using Streamlit and PandasAI. Users can upload their datasets and ask questions or prompts about the data, receiving generated responses in real time.

## ✨ Features

- 📊 Upload CSV files for analysis.
- 📝 Enter prompts to interact with the dataset.
- 🤖 Generate responses based on the provided prompts using OpenAI's language model.

## 📋 Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required packages:
  - `streamlit`
  - `pandas`
  - `python-dotenv`
  - `pandasai`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas python-dotenv pandasai
```

🚀 Setup
Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KarolinaKovalPSU/pandas-ai-streamlit.git
cd pandas-ai-streamlit
